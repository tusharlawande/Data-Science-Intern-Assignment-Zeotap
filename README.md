Tasks Overview
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed data exploration on Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv.
Visualized customer distribution, product categories, and sales trends.
Derived actionable business insights, including customer behavior and product performance.
Deliverables:
Code: EDA.ipynb
Report: EDA_Report.pdf
2. Lookalike Model
Built a recommendation system to identify similar customers using cosine similarity.
Processed CustomerID and Transaction data to generate a customer-product matrix.
Recommended the top 3 similar customers for the first 20 customers (C0001 - C0020).
Deliverables:
Code: Lookalike.ipynb
Output: Lookalike.csv
3. Customer Segmentation/Clustering
Applied clustering techniques (K-Means) to segment customers based on purchase behavior.
Evaluated cluster quality using the Davies-Bouldin Index.
Visualized clusters using PCA for better interpretability.
Deliverables:
Code: Clustering.ipynb
Output: ClusteringResults.csv
